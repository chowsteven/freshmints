<!-- LESSONS LEARNED -->
## Lessons Learned and Afterthoughts

This project was my first desktop application. I wanted to get this up and running quickly so I decided to stick with TypeScript, which I was already familiar with. Electron seemed to be the best framework to use for such a project. If I had decided to use a different language, I would have went with Python because I've been meaning to dust off the cobwebs for it recently.

Anyway, I came across a lot of challenges when using Electron - learning the inter-process communication, things about security and writing to the file system.. a bunch of the "usual" challenges, from what I can tell. I would say it was pretty difficult but rewarding; it was kind of cool using a browser language for a desktop application. So big props to the people at Electron.

It was also fun learning about the intricacies of Ethereum and the mempool and all that, but most of the heavy lifting was done by the Ethers library. It was really easy to get things going because of the great Ethers API!

There's a lot more to that I need to implement. The two most important ones are getting the dependencies right so Webpack stops yelling and fixing the errors that are displayed to the user. Coming soon...
